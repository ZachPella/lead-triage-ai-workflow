## Lead Classification Logic

### Priority Levels
- **High**: Enterprise clients, security reviews, urgent requests with budget
- **Medium**: Mid-market prospects with concrete needs or referrals
- **Low**: Small companies with vague interest
- **Spam**: Crypto, affiliate marketing, promotional content

### Categories
- **Demo**: Demo, pilot, trial, or sandbox requests
- **Security**: SOC2, ISO, SSO, BAA, DPA compliance inquiries
- **Support**: Login, API, webhook, or billing issues
- **Pricing**: Pricing, tiers, or seat count questions
- **Sales**: General evaluation inquiries
- **Spam**: Promotional or irrelevant content

## Email Templates

### Internal Handoffs (Demo/Security)
- **To**: Assigned team member
- **Subject**: "New [category] lead ‚Äì [company] ‚Äì [name]"
- **Content**: Need summary, key context, proposed next steps

### Prospect Responses (Support/Pricing/Sales)
- **To**: Lead's email address
- **Subject**: "Re: [company] ‚Äì next steps"
- **Content**: Acknowledgment, helpful information, clear call-to-action

## Customization

### Modifying Classification Rules

Edit the system prompt in the "Lead Triage Agent" node to adjust:
- Priority criteria
- Category definitions
- Routing logic
- Email template selection

### Adding New Categories

1. Update the system prompt with new category definitions
2. Add corresponding entries to the Team Routing Info sheet
3. Create email templates for the new category

### Extending Functionality

The workflow can be extended with additional tools:
- Calendar scheduling integration
- CRM system updates
- Slack notifications
- Custom webhook triggers

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Track
- Lead processing time
- Classification accuracy
- Email response rates
- Team workload distribution

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Review and update classification criteria
- Update email templates based on performance
- Monitor for new spam patterns
- Validate team routing assignments

## Security Considerations

- All API credentials are stored securely in n8n
- Email drafts are created but not automatically sent
- Lead data remains within your Google Workspace
- AI processing uses encrypted connections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow not triggering**
   - Verify Google Sheets trigger permissions
   - Check sheet ID and name configuration

2. **Classification errors**
   - Review system prompt for clarity
   - Check AI model configuration

3. **Email draft creation fails**
   - Verify Gmail OAuth2 permissions
   - Check email template formatting
